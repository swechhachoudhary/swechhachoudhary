### Hi üëã I'm Swechha!

üî≠ I‚Äôm actively looking for full-time Machine Learning/Software Engineer position.

I'm pursuing a professional master's in Machine Learning at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/person/swechha/), Universit√© de Montr√©al. I did my Bachelors in Electrical Engineering from IITK (Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur), India in 2016. I have 2 years of experience in building end-to-end ML systems in Computer Vision and NLP domain through various internships and course work. 

I have worked on various machine learning techniques ranging from classical Matrix Factorization to deep neural networks such as CNNs, RNNs, Auto-encoder, etc. I've studied a variety of graduate courses: Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, NLP, and Probabilistics Graphical Models, and undergrad courses: Probability & Statistics, Linear Algebra, Data Structures and Algorithms, and Intro to C programming.

During my undergrad years, I also worked as a technology analyst and an android developer. 

Last summer, I worked on a cool side project: [Handwriting mimic app](https://youtu.be/Ghsb3w0QACI), as a part of this project I created a end-to-end ML system from implementing ML model to creating website. **Using this app, you can generate text in your own handwriting style**. The ML model is a generative model for real-valued sequence data composed of stacked LSTM layers from [‚ÄúGenerating Sequences With Recurrent Neural Networks‚Äù](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1308.0850.pdf) paper by Alex Graves.

For more details about this project [github](https://github.com/swechhachoudhary/Handwriting-synthesis). Have fun writing some cool stuff!!

I'm fascinated by the field of machine learning and its potential in solving interdisciplinery problems. I'm open for collaboration to work on some cool and impactful ideas to solve problems at the intersection of computer vision and NLP.
